# Practice in the Terminal
-----------------------

#### The Command Line

- What is it, how does it work and how do I get to one?
The command line is a text-based interface used to interact with a computer's operating system. It provides users with a way to execute various commands and programs by typing and submitting textual commands instead of using a graphical user interface.
If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) .

### More About Files 

The first thing we need to appreciate with linux is that under the hood, everything is actually a file. A text file is a file, a directory is a file, your keyboard is a file.

### Manual Pages 

Learn how to make the most of the Linux commands you are learning.

   The Linux command line offers many opportunities and the manual pages are an excellent resource that explains every command available on the system. You can access the manual pages with the "man [command]" command and use the "--help" option for a brief overview of the command's usage. To become proficient at Linux, learn the command line options and chain commands together using pipes.
