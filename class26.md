### Android fundamentals

 What is an Intent in Android Studios? Give some fresh examples of when you might use it.<br>
 An Intent is a messaging object in Android Studio that allows different app components, such as activities, services, and broadcast receivers, to communicate with each other at runtime. It is an asynchronous operation that describes an action to be taken, along with optional data to be passed between components. Intents can be explicit, meaning they target a specific component within an app, or implicit, meaning they allow the system to find the best component to handle the request based on the user's context. Some examples of when to use an Intent include starting a new activity, sending a broadcast message, or invoking a service.


Describe an Activity in your own word.<br>
 An Activity in Android is a single, focused and independent user interface component that represents a particular screen or part of an app. It provides a visual interface that users can interact with to accomplish a particular task or to view some information. Activities usually correspond to one of the app's main functions or features. For example, in a music player app, an activity could be created for searching for music, another one for creating a playlist, and another one for playing music. One of the primary roles of an activity is to manage the user interface and handle users' interactions with it. An activity also has a defined lifecycle that allows the app to manage its resources efficiently and respond to system messages or changes in device state.
