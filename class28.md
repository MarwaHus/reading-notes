### What makes a RecyclerView dynamic?<br>
A RecyclerView is dynamic because it recycles individual elements as they scroll off the screen and creates new elements for those that scroll onto the screen. This allows for more efficient use of memory and resources, as well as improved performance and responsiveness in the app. Additionally, the layout of the RecyclerView can be easily customized using different layout managers and view holders, allowing for a wide range of dynamic display options for large sets of data.<br>
