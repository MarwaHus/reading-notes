### How are releases and versioning related?
Releases and versioning are closely related in the context of software development. In order to understand this relationship, it's important to understand the terms separately:

1. Releases: A release refers to the distribution of a new version or iteration of a software application to end-users. It can be considered as a milestone that marks the availability of new features, bug fixes, improvements, and other changes to the application.

2. Versioning: Versioning is the process of assigning a unique identifier to a specific release of an application. Version numbers help developers and users track the progress of an application, understand the changes between different releases, and manage compatibility issues.
   
### What are the 5 main tasks you need to complete to prepare your application for release to the Google Play Store?
To prepare an application for release on the Google Play Store, the following five main tasks need to be completed:

1. Testing: Thoroughly test the application to ensure it is free from major bugs, crashes, and usability issues. This includes functional testing, compatibility testing, and performance testing.

2. Building the Release APK: Generate a signed and optimized APK (Android application package) file that can be uploaded to the Google Play Store. This involves configuring the build process, generating the necessary signing keys, and producing a release-ready version of the application.

3. Defining Release Channels and Distribution: Determine the desired release channels, such as production, beta, or alpha, and configure the appropriate versioning and distribution channels in the Google Play Console. This involves setting up release tracks, managing version codes, and deciding when and how the application will be made available to users.

4. Preparing Store Listing and Assets: Create and optimize the store listing and assets, including the application's title, description, screenshots, icons, and promotional graphics. This helps attract users and provide them with relevant information about the application.

5. Pre-release Testing and Rollout Planning: Conduct pre-release tests with a limited set of users to gather feedback, identify any remaining issues, and validate the release before a wider rollout. Determine the rollout strategy, including staged rollouts, phased releases, or immediate availability, based on requirements and the readiness of the application.
