##### What is a technology youâ€™ve used before that is similar to Shared Preferences?<br>
A technology that is similar to SharedPreferences is localStorage in web development. Both allow you to save key-value pairs and retrieve them later from storage. However, localStorage is specific to web browsers and is used to store data in the browser's client side storage. SharedPreferences on the other hand is specific to Android and is used to store data in the app's private or shared preferences. Both aim to provide a simple solution for storing data.

##### Why is testing important? Give at least 4 reasons, and explain which is the most important to you and why.<br>
Testing is an important aspect of software development that ensures that the software being developed is of high quality and meets the requirements of the end-users. Below are four reasons why testing is important:

1. To improve quality and reliability: Testing helps to identify errors and defects in software, which can be corrected before the software is released. This helps to improve the quality and reliability of the software, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the users.<br>

2. To save time and money: Detecting and fixing defects early in the software development process can save time and money. The cost of fixing defects increases as the software development process progresses, so identifying and resolving issues early on can be much cheaper than waiting until later stages of development.<br>

3. To increase user satisfaction: Testing ensures that software is reliable, functional, and easy to use, which can lead to increased user satisfaction. When users can use software without encountering errors or bugs, they are more likely to be satisfied with the product.<br>
4. To comply with regulations: In some industries such as healthcare and finance, software must comply with regulatory requirements. Testing helps to ensure that software meets these regulations and avoids any legal or financial penalties associated with non-compliance.<br>

##### Create an analogy for Tasks and the back stack. Have we used a similar system before? Explain.<br>
Tasks and the back stack can be compared to a pile of dishes in a sink. Each task is a dish, and the back stack is the pile of dishes waiting to be washed. Similar to tasks, each dish has a specific use and can only be washed once it is complete and no longer needed. As tasks are completed and moved off the back stack, they become like clean dishes that can be put away until they are needed again.

We have used a similar system before with web browsers and their history tab. The history tab keeps track of the pages we visit and organizes them in a chronological order like a back stack. This allows us to easily navigate between previously visited pages. Just like the back stack in Android, as new pages are visited, they are added to the history tab and older pages are pushed further back and eventually removed from the tab to make space for new pages. This system provides a way to easily retrace our steps and find things we were previously looking at.
