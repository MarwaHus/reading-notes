#### In non-technical terms, what service does Amazon Polly provide?

In non-technical terms, Amazon Polly is a service provided by Amazon that uses advanced technology to convert text into natural-sounding speech. It allows businesses and developers to integrate speech functionality into their applications, products, or services.
#### What are the benefits of the Amazon Polly service?

Some of the benefits of using Amazon Polly include:

* High quality – Amazon Polly offers both new neural TTS and best-in-class standard TTS technology to synthesize the superior natural speech with high pronunciation accuracy (including abbreviations, acronym expansions, date/time interpretations, and homograph disambiguation).

* Low latency – Amazon Polly ensures fast responses, which make it a viable option for low-latency use cases such as dialog systems.

* Support for a large portfolio of languages and voices – Amazon Polly supports dozens of voices languages, offering male and female voice options for most languages. This number will continue to increase as we bring more neural voices online. US English voices Matthew and Joanna can also use the Neural Newscaster speaking style, similar to what you might hear from a professional news anchor.

* Cost-effective – Amazon Polly's pay-per-use model means there are no setup costs. You can start small and scale up as your application grows.

* Cloud-based solution – On-device TTS solutions require significant computing resources, notably CPU power, RAM, and disk space. These can result in higher development costs and higher power consumption on devices such as tablets, smart phones, and so on. In contrast, TTS conversion done in the AWS Cloud dramatically reduces local resource requirements. This enables support of all the available languages and voices at the best possible quality. Moreover, speech improvements are instantly available to all end-users and do not require additional updates for devices.
