# Graphs

### What is Graph?

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).

### why to use graphs?

Graphs can be used to model a wide range of real-world applications, such as social networks, web pages, computer networks, transportation systems, and biological networks. They are used to analyze and study these systems, solve problems, and make decisions.

### How to use graphs

To use a graph, you typically need to define the nodes and edges and then perform various operations on them. Some common operations include:

1. Adding a node or an edge: This involves creating new nodes or edges and connecting them to the existing structure.

2. Removing a node or an edge: This involves deleting nodes or edges from the graph.

3. Traversing the graph: This involves visiting each node in the graph in a specific order to perform some operation or search for a specific node or information.

4. Finding shortest paths: This involves finding the shortest path between two nodes in the graph. Algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm or the A* search algorithm can be used for this purpose.

5. Analyzing the connectivity or structure of the graph: This involves understanding the relationships between different nodes and identifying patterns or clusters within the graph.

We use graphs because they provide a flexible and powerful way to represent and analyze relationships between entities or objects. They can help in solving complex problems by modeling real-world scenarios and enabling efficient and effective algorithms for various tasks. Graphs offer a visually intuitive representation of data, making it easier to understand and interpret complex relationships, dependencies, and connections.
