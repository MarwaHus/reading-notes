### OAuth
1. In non-technical terms, describe what using OAuth can provide for your application.<br>
   OAuth is a process that allows users to grant a website or application access to their data on another website or application. This means that with OAuth, users do not need to create new login credentials for every application they use. OAuth provides more convenience and security when logging in or accessing user data across different platforms by letting users authenticate using an existing account they already have.

2. Which authentication providers are covered in the tutorial?<br>
   The tutorial covers using OAuth 2.0 for authentication with two providers: GitHub and Google. The tutorial also mentions the possibility of adding a local user database for authentication as well.
