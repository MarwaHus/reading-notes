# The Growth Mindset

### Upgrade your technical skills with deliberate practice
To upgrade hard technical skills, deliberate practice is necessary. Challenges should push you just outside your comfort zone, be repeated often, have constant feedback, require mental exhaustion, and have clear goals. The Matasano Crypto Challenges and Rosalind are examples of challenges that meet these criteria. It's important to set small, finishable challenges that teach you something outside your comfort zone.

###  Carol Dweck on the Growth Mindset. 
Carol Dweck discusses the importance of adopting a growth mindset over a fixed mindset. She highlights how students who are taught to embrace the power of yet and see failure as a learning opportunity, are more likely to persevere, engage deeply, and correct their mistakes. Dweck offers some practical ways to promote yet, including praising effort and progress and creating game-rewards that incentivize effort and strategy rather than right answers. She notes this kind of growth mindset can lead to greater equality in the classroom and beyond. By embracing the idea that abilities can be developed, Dweck argues that we can create a world filled with yet where all children have the right to grow and thrive.

###  Angela Lee Duckworth on Grit.
Angela Duckworth shares her research on the concept of grit and its impact on success. She defines grit as passion and perseverance for long-term goals and emphasizes that it is an essential characteristic that predicts achievement across various contexts, from the military to education to sales. Duckworth's findings demonstrate that grit is a significant predictor of success, even when controlling for other factors like IQ and socioeconomic status. She acknowledges the challenge of building grit in individuals and suggests that a growth mindset, the belief that abilities can be developed through effort, is a promising approach. However, Duckworth highlights the need for further research and experimentation to better understand how to foster grit in individuals. Ultimately, she encourages a dedication to cultivating grit in order to support the success and well-being of individuals, especially children.

###  Alain de Botton on Redefining Success.
Alain De Botton’s TED Talk explores the reasons why individuals often experience career crises and feelings of anxiety about their professional lives. He argues that society has placed too much emphasis on job snobbery and meritocracy, causing individuals to focus too much on their status in the social hierarchy and leading to feelings of envy and failure. De Botton suggests that individuals should focus on owning their own ideas of success and being true to themselves instead of trying to meet societal expectations. He also stresses that success does not mean being successful at everything and that it is important to accept the element of loss in one’s life. Instead of fearing failure and judgement, De Botton suggests turning to the idea of tragedy and being more sympathetic towards those who have failed.

###  Emotional Intelligence.

After taking the Emotional Intelligence assessment , I have gained new insights into my emotional tendencies. The assessment  broke down my score into categories such as self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. I was pleased to see that I scored high in self-awareness and empathy, but identified some areas where I could improve, particularly in self-regulation. I realized that I sometimes struggle with managing my emotional reactions in stressful situations, and that this is an area I need to work on. Overall, the assessment  was a helpful tool for me to understand my strengths as well as areas for improvement in regards to emotional intelligence.

###  Biases.

After taking the Bias Self-Assessment survey, I gained new insights into my implicit biases. The survey broke down my score into categories such as race, gender, age, sexual orientation, and religion. I was pleased to see that I scored low in bias towards most categories. However, I was surprised to see that I had a slightly higher score in bias towards age. This made me realize that I may hold some unconscious assumptions or beliefs about people based on their age, and I need to be more aware of this in my interactions with others. Overall, the survey was a helpful tool for me to identify areas where my biases may be affecting my interactions with others, and to become more mindful of these biases moving forward.
