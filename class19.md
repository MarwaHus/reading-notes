### Purely functional programming, from Wikipedia.

1. Can you change the state of a data structure using functional programming?<br>
   In pure functional programming, data structures are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered once they are created. Therefore, there is no concept of changing the state of a data structure in functional programming.
2. Define purely functional programming.<br>
   Purely functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions. In a purely functional program, all values are immutable and the program avoids the use of side effects, or changes to the state of the program outside of the function's input and output. This means that a function will always return the same output for a given set of inputs and will not modify any other part of the program
3. How do you think purely functional programming will differ from the programs youâ€™ve written so far in this course?<br>
   Java is an imperative and object-oriented programming language, which means that it focuses on describing how program actions should be executed and makes extensive use of mutable state and objects to organize program logic. In contrast, pure functional programming languages emphasize the computation of values based on immutable data structures and functions without side effects or mutable state.
