### Java Imports:
1. Use an analogy to explain Built-In packages. Give examples.
   
  Built-In packages are like premade toolboxes that come with a new house. They are ready-to-use functionalities that make it easier for developers to do their job without having to create everything from scratch. Examples of Built-In packages in Java:
-  java.util, java.io, java.lang


2. Explain the steps for creating a new package in IntelliJ.

- Open IntelliJ and create a new project.
- Right-click on the "src" folder in the project view.
- Select "New" > "Package".
- Name your package and click "OK".
- Add new classes or files to the package by right-clicking on it and selecting "New" > "Java Class" or "File".
- Use the package in your code by importing it at the beginning of your files.

### Different types of loops in Java

1. Which loop types use a loop counter?
   - For loop
   - While loop
   - Do-while loop
  
2. Explain the difference between While and Do-While loops.
    The difference between the two is simply where the conditional check is done. In the while loop, the code inside the loop will not execute at all if the condition is false in the beginning. In contrast, in the do-while loop, the code inside the loop will execute at least once before the loop condition is checked.

### Java Arrays
1. Describe 3 built-in methods for Arrays.
    - Arrays.sort(): This method sorts the elements in an array in ascending order
    - Arrays.copyOf(): This method creates a new array with the specified length and copies elements from the source array into it.
    - Arrays.fill(): This method fills an array with a specified value.
2. How is the size of an array determined in Java?
   The size of an array in Java is determined at the time of its creation. When we create an array in Java, we have to specify its size in square brackets following the array's data type. For example, to create an array of integers with a size of 5, we would use the following code: int[] myArray = new int[5];
